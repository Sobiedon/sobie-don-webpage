        <h1>Research Interests</h1>
        <p>My research focuses on the transformative role of artificial intelligence in driving innovation and enhancing business strategy. I’m particularly interested in how AI technologies revolutionize industries through improved customer experiences, optimized risk management, and more effective product development.

I recently completed a research paper titled “From Strategic Intent to Effective AI Implementation: Does Strategic Intent Translate into AI Implementation?” This work explores how clearly defined strategic intent—supported by leadership—guides the successful integration of AI within organizations. It draws on real-world examples from Union Pacific, Mutual of Omaha, Siemens, and others to demonstrate how AI initiatives can align with long-term goals and create sustainable competitive advantage.

Through this study, I aim to bridge the gap between emerging AI technologies and their practical, strategic application in solving real-world business challenges.

I continue to engage with industry leaders and participate in conferences to stay current on AI’s evolving impact across sectors.</p>
