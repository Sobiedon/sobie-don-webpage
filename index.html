            <h1>Sobie Don</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m Sobie Don (Julie)! I’m a lifelong learner, researcher, and community advocate, dedicated to leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges and empowering those around me. I graduated from the <strong>University of Nebraska Omaha</strong>, earning my undergraduate degree in <strong>Information Systems</strong>, followed by dual master’s degrees in <strong>Business Administration (MBA)</strong> and <strong>Management Information Systems (MIS)</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>I am passionate about <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> and its potential to transform industries and improve everyday lives. I’m particularly fascinated by <strong>neural networks</strong>—their ability to mimic human brain functions in analyzing data and recognizing patterns—and how they can create smarter, adaptive systems. I am also passionate about advancing <strong>human-AI interaction</strong>, designing systems that work alongside humans to enhance decision-making, creativity, and efficiency in both personal and corporate environments.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond my professional focus, I am committed to building strong communities. I co-founded <strong>Nebraska Women of Color in Tech</strong>, an organization that creates a sense of community, empowers women, and provides mentorship and career opportunities in tech. I also serve as the <strong>Co-Chair of the Professional Networking Committee</strong> at <strong>UPTIES</strong>, a Union Pacific Employee Resource Group (ERG), where I lead initiatives that support community organizations, such as <strong>College Possible</strong>, to create brighter futures for underserved students.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to these roles, I coordinated the <strong>Tech Department at Union Pacific</strong>, helping to lead a company-wide fundraising effort that raised an impressive <strong>$950,000 for United Way</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>When I’m not working, researching, or volunteering, I enjoy traveling, trying out new restaurants, and playing golf.</p>
